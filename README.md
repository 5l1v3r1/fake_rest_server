Simple and easy-to-configure REST server made in PHP.

I made it just to create different fake REST servers very fast for testing purposes.

To add new paths (routes) and methods, the developer just needs to create a new folder (and subfolders if needed) which represent the route and inside one file per method named [method_desired].php (for example, put.php).

It is very easy to extend using PHP language. The code already includes some routes, methods, functions and data (user accounts, etc.) as examples but they can be deleted.
